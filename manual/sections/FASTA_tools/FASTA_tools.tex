%Write something about FASTA tools

Current available FASTA tools, for analysis and manipulation, are:
\begin{enumerate}
\item \texttt{goose-fasta2seq}: it converts a FASTA or Multi-FASTA file format to a seq.
\item \texttt{goose-fastaextract}: it extracts sequences from a FASTA file, which the range is defined by the user in the parameters.
\item \texttt{goose-fastaextractbyread}: it extracts sequences from each read in a Multi-FASTA file (splited by \textbackslash n), which the range is defined by the user in the parameters.
\item \texttt{goose-fastainfo}: it shows the readed information of a FASTA or Multi-FASTA file format.
\item \texttt{goose-mutatefasta}: it reates a synthetic mutation of a fasta file given specific rates of editions, deletions and additions.
\item \texttt{goose-randfastaextrachars}: it substitues in the DNA sequence the outside ACGT chars by random ACGT symbols.
\item \texttt{goose-geco}
\item \texttt{goose-gede}
\item \texttt{goose-reverse}%: it reverses the order of a sequence.

%Incomplete tools
%%\item \texttt{goose-reverselm}%: it reverses the order of a large sequence. Low memory usage for large files.
\end{enumerate}
