\item \texttt{goose-char2line}: it transforms each char into a char in each line.
\item \texttt{goose-sum}: it adds the second column value to the first column value.
\item \texttt{goose-min}: it finds the minimum value between two column values.
\item \texttt{goose-minus}: it substracts the second column value to the first column value.
\item \texttt{goose-max}: it finds the mmaximum value between two column values.
\item \texttt{goose-extract}: it extracts a subsequence of a sequence by coordinates.
\item \texttt{goose-segment}: it segments a sequence given a certain threshold.
